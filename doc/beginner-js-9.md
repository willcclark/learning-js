* Three ways to declare variables in JavaScript:
    + _var_
    + _let_
    + _const_
    + For example:
    ```javascript
    var one = 1;
	let two = 2;
    const three = 3;
    ```
* Each Keyword has its own purpose!
    + _var_
        - Original way to declare variables in JavaScript
		- A function scoped variable declaration, meaning that the variable, when defined, is available anywhere within that function.
		- The variable is even available in the function before it was declared.
		- The variable can be changed within the scope, meaning it is a immutable variable type. It can be reassigned, its data type can be changed
    + _let_
