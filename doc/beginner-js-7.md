What are code comments?
* Comments are lines in your code that you can see, but that do not get executed

* Single line comments
    + Add two // to the beginning of a line
    + Most editors will change the color of the line to grey
    + only applies to the current line - Any subsequent lines will not be commeneted out.
    + For example:
```
// console.log(I am commented out");
console.log("But I'm not!")
```
